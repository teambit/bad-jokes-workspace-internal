import styles from './index';

### Overview

#### Componentized CSS

Using CSS as a component is a relatively undocumented phenomenon, but can be a very powerful tool
for creating shareable CSS templates as well as sharing 'global' styling and variables; without needing
to actually make them global, and whilst taking advantage of the many strengths of css modules.

The key to the magic of a CSS component is in creating an index.js (or .ts) file alongside the CSS files you want 
to componentize, which becomes an entry file into the component. 
By simply exporting the styles as is, you can then consume the component with a simple "import styles from 'component-path'" (no need for /index as npm 
knows to go there) and presto your styles can be used as styles.css_class

Here we've used css (or scss in this case) modules as they have a number of additional benefits (e.g. no css collisions), which are supported out of the box 
by the default Bit react environment (as is less/less modules). You can also use standard css files for the same effect.

``` js live
() => {
  return (
    <>
    Using styles from a css component:
    Change the classname to styles.blueish to see the styling change from the external module
    <p className={styles.reddish}>Lovely styling from my css component</p>
    </>

  )
}


```
